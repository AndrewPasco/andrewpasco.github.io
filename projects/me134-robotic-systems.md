## ME134 — Robotic Systems (Interactive Robot Backgammon)

5-DOF manipulator that plays interactive backgammon with vision-based board and checker detection.

Term-long team project designing a 5-DOF arm and ROS2-based control system to play interactive backgammon. Responsibilities:
- Mechanical link and joint design, fabrication
- Board & checker perception using OpenCV (ArUco markers)
- Motion planning, task sequencing, and system-level integration

Outcome: Reliable operation and A+ grade for the course; demo video referenced in portfolio.
