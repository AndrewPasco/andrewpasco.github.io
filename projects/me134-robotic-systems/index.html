<p>5-DOF manipulator that plays interactive backgammon with vision-based board and checker detection.</p>

<p>Term-long team project designing a 5-DOF arm and ROS2-based control system to play interactive backgammon. Responsibilities:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Mechanical link and joint design, fabrication</li>
  <li>Board &amp; checker perception using OpenCV (ArUco markers)</li>
  <li>Motion planning, task sequencing, and system-level integration</li>
</ul>

<p>Outcome: Reliable operation and A+ grade for the course; demo video referenced in portfolio.</p>
