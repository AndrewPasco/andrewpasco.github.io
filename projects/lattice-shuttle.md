## LATTICE Shuttle

Carbon fiber cable-riding shuttle for lunar mobility research (NASA BIG Idea Challenge).

Worked on transitioning concept to product: carbon fiber skeleton design, gearbox plates, and passive pulley fabrication. Tasks included CNC and waterjet coordination, structural design, and on-site testing.
