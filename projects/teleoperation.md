## iPhone Teleoperation Interface

Hand-pose and gesture-based smartphone teleoperation system. TrueDepth + MediaPipe + ROS integration, user testing, and usability analysis.

Developed a smartphone-based teleoperation interface using the iPhone TrueDepth camera and MediaPipe for hand tracking and gesture recognition. The system streams RGB-D and gesture signals to a ROS backend to control a remote manipulator. Work included:
- Interface and experimental design
- System integration (iOS Swift + ROS)
- User testing across geographic locations and usability benchmarking

Related artifacts:
- MPhil thesis (see portfolio PDF) and an arXiv preprint link (if available).
