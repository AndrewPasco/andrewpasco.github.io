# Athletics

I’ve always balanced academics with athletics: swimming, strength training, and now long-distance endurance events.  

Before the end of undergrad, swimming was my most important commitment outside of my academics. A few highlights include:

- Helping Caltech place 3rd at SCIAC Championships in 2022 and 2023, tying our highest-ever finish
- Setting school records in the 200 I.M. (1:51.92) and 400 I.M. (4:01.11) at the 2024 SCIAC Championships
- Receiving the SCIAC Character Award and Caltech Director's award at the end of my final year

I'm currently training for an **Ironman 70.3** (Oceanside 2026), which has been a fun long-term training goal in my post-swimming life.  

Between the end of swimming at Caltech and this new goal, I have raced in a few 5ks, a 10k, and the Cambridge Half Marathon.

I also competed with the Cambridge Blues Swimming Team and the Water Polo Seconds Team in the 2025 varsity matches against Oxford!

# Travel

I love exploring new cities, cultures, and experiencing other regions' nature.  
Here are a few memorable stops:

- Spending two weeks in Vietnam (visiting Ho Chi Minh City and the surrounding area) and Cambodia (visiting the Angkor Archaeological Park)  
- Hiking in national parks across the US, including Zion, Bryce Canyon, and Grand Teton  
- Visiting Seoul, Tokyo, and Jeju Island  
- Seeing industrial sites and locations of cultural importance across France, including Bordeaux, Lyon, Paris, and Lille
