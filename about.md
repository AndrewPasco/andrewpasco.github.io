# About Me
I am currently pursuing an MS in Mechanical Engineering at Stanford, with a focus in robotics. I plan to graduate in March, 2027, then apply my learned skills to robotics and automation or electric vehicles in industry, engineering innovative solutions!

From October 2024 to August 2025, I attended the University of Cambridge, studying for an MPhil in Industrial Systems, Manufacturing, and Management. My MPhil thesis investigated the feasibility of smartphone-enabled, gesture and hand pose based remote telerobotic manipulation through novel system design and user testing, and a manuscript based on this thesis is currently under review for ICRA 2026. I will officially graduate on the 29th November, 2025.

I am also a 2024 Caltech graduate with a double option in Mechanical Engineering and Business, Economics, and Management. In university, I was a two-year captain for the NCAA Division III Men's Swim Team, Fleming House President, and TA for multiple courses in the MechE department. During three summers interning at Beta Technologies, I gained valuable practical design experience, a lasting passion for electric vehicles, and an ethical engineering outlook to complement my studies.
