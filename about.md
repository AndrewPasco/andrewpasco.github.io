# About Me
I am currently pursuing an MS in Mechanical Engineering at Stanford, with a focus in robotics. My current coursework is focused along two axes: continuing to learn the “traditional”
robotics controls and software principles which I began studying during my last terms at Caltech, and building my proficiency with machine learning theory and methods that are 
increasingly utilized throughout the robotics stack. I plan to graduate in March 2027, then apply my learned skills to robotics and automation or electric vehicles in industry, engineering innovative solutions!

From October 2024 to August 2025, I attended the University of Cambridge on the fully funded Schilt Studentship for United States Students from Trinity College, studying for an MPhil in Industrial Systems, Manufacturing, and Management. My MPhil thesis investigated the feasibility of smartphone-enabled, gesture and hand pose based remote telerobotic manipulation through novel system design and user testing, and a manuscript based on this thesis is currently under review for ICRA 2026. I will officially graduate on November 29th, 2025.

I am also a 2024 Caltech graduate with a double option in Mechanical Engineering and Business, Economics, and Management. In university, I was a two-year captain for the NCAA Division III Men's Swim Team, Fleming House President, and TA for multiple courses in the MechE department. During three summers as a mechanical engineering intern at Beta Technologies, I gained valuable practical design experience, a lasting passion for electric vehicles, and an ethical engineering outlook to complement my studies.
