### Who am I?

I am a mechanical engineer focused on robotics and human-robot interaction. My background spans mechanical design, fabrication, and robot perception/control. I enjoy building physical systems that are robust and user-friendly.

**Education**
- MS Candidate, Mechanical Engineering — Stanford University (Sep 2025 – Mar 2027)
- MPhil, Industrial Systems, Manufacture, and Management — University of Cambridge (Oct 2024 – Aug 2025)
- BS, Mechanical Engineering & BEM — California Institute of Technology (Sep 2020 – Jun 2024)

I completed an MPhil thesis titled **"Exploring Smartphone‑Enabled Gesture Input for Intuitive Robot Teleoperation"** which studied usability, design, and integration of an iPhone gesture/hand-pose interface with ROS-based teleoperation systems.

**Interests:** manipulation capabilities, HRI, manufacturing applications, and mechanical design/fabrication.
